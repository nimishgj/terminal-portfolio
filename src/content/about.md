## About Me

Hello! I'm **Nimisha G J**, a software developer with 1 year of experience.

I'm currently working on observability solutions at Infraspec, helping companies monitor and understand their systems better.

I'm passionate about building robust backend systems and cloud infrastructure.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the outdoors through trekking, traveling, and bike riding. As a computer science engineering student, I'm on a continuous journey to expand my knowledge and contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape. Let's connect and build something incredible together!
